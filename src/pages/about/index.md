# About Me

I am front-end developer located in Toronto, Canada. I love designing and building applications with great UI/UX.

Classical music is another of my passions. My most beloved composer is Johann Sebastian Bach.

I am currently working on a personal project, a music player that runs on Windows, specificly designed for classical music. The project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) based on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). Stay tuned for the release!
